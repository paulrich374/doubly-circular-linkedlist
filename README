Is there are any tests in the standard test suite that you know that it's not
working and you don't want the grader to run it at all so you won't get extra
deductions, please list them here.  (Of course, if the grader won't run these
tests, you will not get plus points for them.)

None.

Comments on design decisions: ?

Make main() code as few as possible.
So create 4 other functions: OpenFile, ReadInput, SortList, PrintList.
SortList use bubble sort due to the list concatenated feature. So it's hard to use insertion sort or something because it needs random access to the list.   

Comments on deviation from spec: ?

None.
